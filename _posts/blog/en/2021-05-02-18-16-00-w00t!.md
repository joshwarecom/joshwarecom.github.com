This blog will be a year-long experiment in public discourse on faith, technology and conscience.

Inspiration for specific topics and themes will come from the phrase "cloudy theology."

At the outset,  I have a few specific starting points in mind. 

1) "Cloudy" as nebulous or opaque, rather than distinct or precise or transparent.  I intend to critically engage this kind of cloudiness in religious discourse.

2) "The Cloud" is a symbol of distributed information technology infrastructure.  My research involves drawing the study of religion into conversation with the study of information technology.

3) God is often rendered as "The Old Man in the Clouds" - even the "Father in Heaven" construction resonates with this.

Let's see where this leads!
