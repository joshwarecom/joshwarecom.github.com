title: what is theology? and why ask?
summary:  an introduction to the content and purpose of this blog.
---

The title "theologian" evokes images of preachers, professors, ancient sages and televangelists.  But what about a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/16/politics/donald-trump-bible-favorite-verse-2016-republican-debate/">man who invents his own bible verses</a> - is he a theologian?

Yes, yes he is.  These days there is no single method, Magisterium, or matriculation to license and regulate people's God-Talk, and let's keep it that way: diagnosing 'blasphemies' and 'heresies' has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phryne#Trial">awkward</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther#Excommunication">unpredictable</a> consequences to say the least.

But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology">Wikipedian opinions</a> notwithstanding, that's what theology is: people's God-Talk.  It is a rich body of art, literature and rhetoric that reflects and guides a human propensity for worship as enshrined in the language and legacy of <A href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%8C%CF%82">θεός</a>: a personal, personable Ultimate Being.

And it is a very, very noisy field.  So if we set out to proceed as scholarly "theologians" - who maintain a sense of discipline, rigour and intellectual honesty alongside our God-Talk - let us at least do so with a very precise idea of what we are doing and why.

With this in mind, this blog maintains a threefold mission:

1 - Explore the viability of 'No Holds Barred' Christian theology
<p class="message">
I intend no questions to be off limits, no truths to be held self evident or taken for granted.  Considering that a theologian ultimately grounds the value of (at least some of) her work in a mystery of faith, is this even possible? Let's find out!
</p>
2 - Examine technocentric criticism as a component of biblical studies
<p class="message">
Contemporary biblical scholarship depends on adapting modern tools and concepts to the task of deriving a richer experience of a holy text than would otherwise be possible.  The bible has history to it, therefore historical criticism; the bible is a work of art, hence literary criticism; the bible was edited, hence redaction criticism; etc.<br><br>
I contend that the bible is and always has been an example of information technology.  There was a time when the illuminated calligraphy of rooms full of scribes was state-of-the-art.  Centuries later, the Bible was the '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program#History">Hello, World</a>' of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg_Bible">Printing Press</a>.<br><br>
What do the lenses and language of our modern, mechanized world have to offer the venerable traditions of biblical scholarship? Let's find out! I call this kind of work technocentric criticism.
</p>

3 - Ally with efforts to expose and dismantle the supremacism that may otherwise find favor in the Bible text and among its confessors.
<p class="message">
The novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a> did more in 500 pages to combat American slavery than the pages of the Bible did in 2000 years of evolution.<br><br>
In the face of the forms of supremacism that yet thrive - patriarchy, racism, anti-LGBTQ discrimination, ableism, animal oppression - let's see if we can do better than that in the 21st century.

Some of the reflections above (especially on a theologian's identity) were inspired by the post below that stops just short of indicting theology for dubious and self-serving contributions to the thoughtscape of scholarship.  It's a good read.  And the blog itself is full of interesting tidbits about Giants In The Earth!
