title: what is theology? and why ask?
summary:  an introduction to the content and purpose of this blog.
---

The title "theologian" evokes images of preachers, professors, ancient sages and televangelists.  But what about a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/16/politics/donald-trump-bible-favorite-verse-2016-republican-debate/" target="_blank">man who invents his own bible verses</a> - is he a theologian?

Yes, yes he is.  These days there is no single method, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magisterium" target="_blank">Magisterium</a>, or matriculation to license and regulate people's God-Talk, and that's fine.  Diagnosing 'blasphemies' and 'heresies' has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phryne#Trial" target="_blank">awkward</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther#Excommunication" target="_blank">unpredictable</a> consequences to say the least.

But <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theology" target="_blank">Wikipedian opinions</a> notwithstanding, that's what theology is: people's God-Talk.  It is a rich body of art, literature and rhetoric that reflects and guides a human propensity for worship as enshrined in the language and legacy of <A href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B8%CE%B5%CF%8C%CF%82" target="_blank">θεός</a>: a personal, personable Ultimate Being.

And it is a very, very noisy field.  So if we set out to proceed as scholarly "theologians" - who maintain a sense of discipline, rigour and intellectual honesty as essential to our God-Talk - let us at least do so with a very precise idea of what we are doing and why.

With this in mind, this blog maintains a threefold focus:

1 - Explore the viability of 'No Holds Barred' Christian theology
<p class="message">
I intend no questions to be off limits, no truths to be held self evident or taken for granted.  Considering that a theologian ultimately grounds the value of (at least some of) her work in a mystery of faith, is this even possible? Let's find out!
</p>
2 - Examine technocentric criticism as a component of biblical studies
<p class="message">
Modern tools enable contemporary biblical scholars to mine their sacred texts for otherwise inaccessible riches of meaning.  The bible is a work of art, hence <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_criticism" target="_blank">literary criticism</a>; increased knowledge of its origins and formation leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_criticism" target="_blank">the historical-critical method</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redaction_criticism" target="_blank">redaction criticism</a>; etc.<br><br>
I contend that the bible is and always has been information technology.  The illuminated calligraphy of a scribe was once state-of-the-art media.  Centuries later, the bible became the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program#History" target="_blank">Hello, World</a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg_Bible" target="_blank">printing press</a>.<br><br>
What do the lenses and language of our modern, mechanized world have to offer the venerable tradition of biblical scholarship? Let's find out! I call this kind of work technocentric criticism.
</p>

3 - Ally with efforts to expose and dismantle the supremacism that may otherwise find favor in sacred texts, among their confessors, and throughout the traditions and cultures which sustain them.
<p class="message">
The novel <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncle_Tom%27s_Cabin" target="_blank">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a> did more in 500 pages to combat American slavery than the pages of the bible did in thousands of years of evolution.<br><br>
In the face of the forms of supremacism that yet thrive - patriarchy, racism, anti-LGBTQ discrimination, ableism, animal oppression - let's see if we can do better than that in the 21st century.

## Featured Article of the Week

Some of the reflections above (especially on a theologian's identity) were inspired by the article below.  The author's operative definition of "theology" is quite different from mine; he is concerned with a specific kind of theology that brands itself as one of the humanities without holding itself accountable to humanity at large.  He stops short of indicting such theology outright for dubious and self-serving contributions to the thoughtscape of scholarship, but his point is poignant: God-Talk may effectively claim to legitimate itself, drawing on the power of its own symbols for the authority to do so.  Taking such claims at face value is an unwise yet common habit.

It's a good read.  And the blog itself is full of juicy tidbits about Giants In The Earth!
