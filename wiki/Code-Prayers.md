# What are code prayers?
A personal daily techno-spiritual discipline of composing a prayer in a programming language, rather than a spoken one.

# Why on earth would you do that?
Psychologically, the idea is to use the grounding force of habit to unite my spiritual thinking with my technical thinking.  I hypothesize that in the long run, this will feel like a healthy habit to have maintained.
