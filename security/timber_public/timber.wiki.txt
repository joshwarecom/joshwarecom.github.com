= About This Script =

TIMBER is a perl script that pulls HTTP log files via the existing log_collector script, in order to simplify and speed up emergency log analysis during attacks.  TIMBER automatically supports for the following features:<br/>
*Pull multiple batches simultaneously
*Extract a random sample from the logs while it pulls to increase efficiency
*Consistent naming convention to identify who, when & why the logs were pulled
*Automatically launch a screen session so the download continues if the connection is lost.
*Preliminary benchmarking shows completion time is comparable to a single batch.
*Can run interactively or automatically via command line options
