= About This Script =

HITME is a perl script that chains awklets together to answer common log questions and lists a quick survey of Top 10 hit patterns visible in the HTTP log file for emergency log analysis conclusions in real time.

All awklet scripts, including those utilized by HITME, are documented in awklets.wiki.txt.

HITME can read gzip compressed or raw text files. Raw text can also be piped to HITME from other scripts or processes.

= Example Syntax =

./hitme.pl logfile.gz

./hitme.pl logfile.txt

zcat logfile.gz | ./hitme.pl

= Current HITME Outputs =

*Top 10 Edge-to-Origin Status Codes (r S)
*Top 10 Edge Request Status Codes (r S)
*Top 10 Forward-to-Origin Methods (f)
*Top 10 Edge Request Methods (r S)
*Top 10 Edge Request IPs (r S)
*Top 10 Edge Request ARLs (r)
*Top 10 Edge Request Paths (S)
*Top 10 Forward-to-Origin ARLs (f)
*Top 10 Edge Request Agents (r S)
*Top 10 Edge-to-Origin Agents (r S)
*Top 10 Edge Request Referers (r S)
*Top 10 Edge Request 404s (r)
*Top 10 Edge Request 404s (S)
*Top 10 Forward-to-Origin 404s (f)

<br/>

NOTE: HITME will only return outputs if the awklet chain returns at least one record; therefore, if the input to hitme does not include any relevant records, then HITME will not include it in the output.<br/>

For example, the command "zcat logfile.gz | ./f2o_full | ./hitme.pl" filters out all log lines except f lines to the origin before piping them to hitme. As a result, HITME will only output results for the items which return f lines.<br/>
