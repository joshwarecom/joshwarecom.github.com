This suite of tools optimizes emergency log collection and analysis when GUI-based tools are slow or unavailable and real-time information is necessary.

During an attack or outage, these tools are used to:
1) download up-to-the minute remote logs
2) sample 1% of those logs randomly during the download; the sample provides 99% accuracy while increasing analysis speed 5x.
3) automate log queries for common questions (Top IPs, user agents, referers, URLs, etc)
4) streamline custom command line queries via a human readable syntax and naming convention.

Specific documentation in wikitext format can be found in the files:
